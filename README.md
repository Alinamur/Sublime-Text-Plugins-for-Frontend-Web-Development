# Sublime Text 3 Plugins for Frontend Web Development

Sublime is great and for many still the best text editor available. But out of the box, it lacks some features that modern competitors have already built-in. Plugins help to stay ahead but it's a hassle to keep up with all of them. In order to help you, I compiled a list of plugins I use for my daily frontend web development. 

If you know plugins that should be on this list, just open an issue. üòâ

## Plugins

### üóÉ Administrative 
These plugins are kind of 'meta' because they are not concerned with writing code.

* [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Package%20Control): The essential package manager.
* [AdvancedNewFile](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AdvancedNewFile): A better way to create new files. For instance, it automatically creates a folder when needed.
* [SideBarEnhacements](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SideBarEnhancements): Adds features such as renaming to the sidebar.
* [A File Icon](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/A%20File%20Icon): Add icons to the files in the sidebar.
* [TodoReview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TodoReview): Scans files for `TODO`s and more.
* [FindKeyConflicts](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/FindKeyConflicts): Key conflicts are inevitably when you use a lot of plugins.
* [Editor Config](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/EditorConfig): Maintain consistent coding styles between different editors.

### ‚å®Ô∏è General 
Useful for all languages.

* [All Complete](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/All%20Autocomplete): Indexes all open files for auto-completion.
* [BracketHighlighter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/BracketHighlighter): Improves the already built-in highlighting.
* [AlignTab](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AlignTab): Align your code by `:`, `=`, `=>`, `%`, ` `, `|` or your own RegEx.
* [GitGutter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/GitGutter): Displays changes in the gutter (left to the line numbers).
* [Git](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Git): Includes some git commands into Sublime.
* [DashDoc](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/DashDoc): Open current selection in [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) on a hot key.
* [Terminal](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Terminal): Open Terminal with current working directory set to the directory of the open file on a hot key.
* [Local History](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Local%20History): Keep a local history of your files. Even though I use git on almost every project, I still don't commit every change. It gives a better feeling to have the possibility to go back to every change.

### ‚òïÔ∏è Javascript
* [Tern for Sublime](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/tern_for_sublime): Static Javascript code analyzer with auto-completion, function argument hints, 'go to definition' and more. The installation and configuration can be a little bit tricky but it's worth it. Choose Tern over [SublimeCodeIntel](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeCodeIntel) (unmaintained) and [JavaScript Completions](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScript%20Completions) (buggy). 
* [JavaScript & NodeJS Snippets](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScript%20%26%20NodeJS%20Snippets)
* [Console Wrap](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Console%20Wrap): Fast way to log to console.
* [Babel](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Babel): Syntax definitions for ES6 JavaScript with React JSX extensions.
* [TypeScript](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TypeScript)
* [Elm Language Support](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Elm%20Language%20Support)


### üé® HTML & CSS 
* [Sass](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sass): Sass is a preprocessor extending CSS and this plugins adds the language support.
* [SassSolutions](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SassSolution): Auto-complete variables/mixins from your 'settings.scss' file.
* [CSS3](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CSS3): Replaces the built-in CSS support with a more up-to-date information. Includes [cssnext](http://cssnext.io) support. Follow the instructions to reduce misbehaviour with other plugins.
* [Emmet](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Emmet): Allows you to write HTML very fast. You have to learn their way though.
* [Color Highlighter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Color%20Highlighter)

### üî• Linter 
Linters help you to spot mistakes in your code early on. In order to make them work properly, check the instructions in the packages. For some, you have to install additional tools.

* [SublimeLinter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter)
* [SublimeLinter-HTML-tidy](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-html-tidy)
* [SublimeLinter-CSSlint](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-csslint)
* [SublimeLinter-contrib-SCSS-lint](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint)
